# [augustt.site](https://augustt.site)

This project is based on the original chanhdai.com repo, which I used as a foundation. Iâ€™ve customized and expanded it further to better reflect my own portfolio, including new sections, styling adjustments, and additional features. The site is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui to ensure a modern, fast, and seamless user experience.

This is a continuously evolving side project where I experiment with new technologies and keep it updated with the latest advancements in web development.
