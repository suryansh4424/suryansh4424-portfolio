# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website: [suryansh4424-portfolio-nope.vercel.app](https://suryansh4424-portfolio-nope.vercel.app/)  

Based on the original [chanhdai.com](https://github.com/ncdai) repo, I customized and expanded it with new sections, styling tweaks, and additional features to reflect my own work and journey.  

Built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**, the site delivers a modern, fast, and seamless experience.  
It’s a continuously evolving side project where I experiment with new technologies and keep things up to date with the latest in web development.

✨ Always a work in progress.
